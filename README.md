## 1. Description

This plugin allows you to generate QR Code within TabrisJS apps using plain javascript. Only for TabrisJS apps. Supported on Android and iOS (as platforms supported by TabrisJS).

This plugin is an adaptation of [Kazuhiko Arase](http://www.d-project.com/) Javascript QR Code Generator Library, initially released under MIT License.

Currently [TabrisJS](https://tabrisjs.com/) does not have any QR Code generator library, so this plugin may help you create QR Code TabrisJS within your TabrisJS applications.

* This plugins is pure JavaScript. No Java code used.
* QR Code generated to TabrisJS Canvas, or as in-memory image you can draw later to TabrisJS Canvas.
* Compatible with [Cordova CLI](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-cli/index.html).
